# Scroll-Triggered 3D Text Effect

A collection of creative 3D text scroll animations built with CSS and JavaScript. This demo showcases three distinct effects:

1. **Cylinder Text Rotation** - Text arranged in a cylindrical formation that rotates as you scroll
2. **Double Circle Animation** - Text positioned in two circular arrangements with dynamic scroll-based movement
3. **Tube Circular Rotation** - Text wrapped around a tube that rotates based on scroll position

The animations are triggered by scroll position and create an immersive 3D experience using CSS transforms and custom JavaScript scroll handlers. Each demo demonstrates different approaches to creating engaging typographic animations for modern web experiences.
